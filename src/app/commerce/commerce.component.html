      <p id="intro" style="margin-left: 10px; font-size: 28px;"><i>Commerce is an integral part of society. The Bachelor of Commerce explores how our desire to trade what we
          have for what we want has shaped how people and nations have interacted for millennia, and how global trade
          and digital disruption are fundamentally changing commerce in society.If you're a clever thinker who likes
          to find solutions to problems and consider ideas in abstract ways, Commerce will teach you to apply your
          thinking in a commercial capacity to influence change.
  
          Commerce is integral to all facets of the economy. It encompasses the diverse and rapidly changing
          activities of the world, including decision-making, leadership, innovation and policy development.</i>
